#Timepark.app

What you currently see is a frontend of my web application called Timepark (backend coming soon).

This app should serve as a time tracker for the users who want to know what amount of time they've spend focusing on a selected task.

You can get to the after-auth section of the app after clicking login/sign in button or simply adding /timer into the URL.

Some of the frontend components are missing like settings and store in the side menu. Also the currency system will be added into the app. User will earn coins by the amount of time spent focusing, however I'm not still sure what items will be available for the coins in the store.

Site is entirely mobile responsive.
